# C-Repo

## 1. Main features of C++ are : -

    > Its Platform independent
    > Object oriented
    > Statically-typed
    > Speed
    > Pointers for memory management

## 2. How C++ is designed by Bjarne stroustrup:

> He first add OOP in C and then useing a compiler called Cfont group up both oop and c and compile it as C++. First version of C++ is 11, further it will be modified and release many version upto 23 or more.

## 3. Namespace in C++ :

- Namespace in c++ is like a region where we can decide what method should be run.
- There are many namespace available like std. Some of then are: Qt framework, Eigen, gtest, etc.
- We can load whole namespace like : `using namespace std;` Here namespace is std
- Load a specific method from a namespace : `using std::cout;`

## 4. Data manipualtion in C++ :

- In any programming language there are three step to oparate. These are like `Store` data, `Process` data and also `Display` the data to the user. In Store we can study about datatypes and constant with help of which we can store the data. In Process we can study about loops, oop, functions, etc. And in Display we can study about how the data will be display to the user.
